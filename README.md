SAMD21 (Arduino Zero) program to use wireless USB keyboard/mouse combo as Amiga 500 keyboard, mouse and joystick. Tested with Logitech MK270. Rudimentary implementation that could be easily improved. Only the most commonly used keys are mapped, more can be added easily. Mouse implementation is a bit "digital" and could use more levels. SAMD21 supports USB 2.0, but only up to full-speed (i.e. 12 Mbps). This is sufficient in most cases, but in case some dongle requires high speed (480 Mbps), it won't work.
